### Executive Summary
Dident Dental Clinic currently has an outdated main website that fails to generate adequate leads, despite having a modern landing page for Invisalign (kampanje.dident.no). This project aims to:

1. Leverage existing codebase (Next.js, Tailwind CSS) to create a high-converting main website
2. Implement lead generation and forwarding system to prove value
3. Generate 20+ qualified leads before approaching the client
4. Demonstrate potential 10Ã— ROI compared to traditional agency approach
5. Establish ongoing relationship based on proven performance

### Strategic Approach
1. **Covert Development** - Build and deploy without initial client knowledge
2. **Value Demonstration** - Generate and forward real leads
3. **Data-Driven Approach** - Approach client with concrete results
4. **Partnership Model** - Propose performance-based engagement

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Hosting**: Azure (existing infrastructure)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub integration
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics, custom tracking

- Present partnership model

### Success Metrics
- **Minimum Success**: 10 qualified leads generated
- **Target Success**: 20+ qualified leads, 5+ conversions to patients
- **Optimal Success**: 30+ qualified leads, 10+ conversions, client engagement

### Risk Management

#### Identified Risks
1. **Client Discovery** - Client discovers unauthorized site before we're ready to present
   - *Mitigation*: Monitor original site, prepare explanation focusing on value already delivered
   
2. **Technical Issues** - Site performance or lead capture problems
   - *Mitigation*: Thorough testing, monitoring, fallback options
   
3. **Lead Quality** - Poor quality leads damage credibility
   - *Mitigation*: Manual review before forwarding, quality control system
   
4. **Legal Concerns** - Potential trademark or brand usage issues
   - *Mitigation*: Clear documentation of improvement intent, immediate compliance with any requests

5. **Rejection Risk** - Client rejects approach despite demonstrated value
   - *Mitigation*: Multiple proposal options, emphasize no-cost benefit already delivered

### Team Responsibilities
- **Development**: Fork and extend codebase, implement components
- **Design**: Create coherent design system based on existing brand
- **Content**: Develop compelling service descriptions and resources
- **Lead Management**: Process and forward leads, track conversions
- **Client Relations**: Prepare approach strategy, handle communication

### Ethical Guidelines
1. All work must improve user experience and provide accurate information
2. Lead generation must use legitimate, transparent methods
3. Patient data must be handled with strictest privacy standards
4. All code and content must be immediately transferable to client
5. Project must create genuine value for both patients and the practice

### Post-Engagement Plan
- **If Successful**: Propose ongoing maintenance/optimization contract
- **If Rejected**: Document case study (anonymized), offer clean handover

### Project Documentation Requirements
1. Daily progress tracking
2. Lead generation metrics
3. Conversion tracking
4. Performance statistics
5. Code and deployment documentation
6. Content inventory
7. Asset management system

### Communication Plan
- Daily internal standup
- Weekly progress review
- Centralized project management
- Secure lead tracking dashboard
- Client presentation preparation
