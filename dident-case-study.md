# Dident Dental Clinic Website Case Study

## Current Situation

- Client: Dident Dental Clinic
- Current landing page: kampanje.dident.no (previously developed)
- Main website: dident.no (outdated and underperforming)


- Hosting: Azure with GitHub integration
for the landing page in this project
## Opportunity Assessment

The main Dident website (dident.no) presents a significant improvement opportunity:
- Poor visual design and user experience
- Likely missing conversion optimization elements
- No clear patient journey/conversion path
- Potential for immediate lead generation improvement

## Strategic Approach

1. **Analysis & Benchmarking**
   - Perform UX/UI audit of current site
   - Research top-performing dental websites
   - Identify conversion optimization opportunities

2. **Website Redesign**
   - Modern, clean aesthetic matching dental industry expectations
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Clear service pages with compelling content
   - Strong calls-to-action throughout

3. **Lead Generation Focus**
   - Implement appointment booking system
   - Create lead magnets (free consultation, whitening guide, etc.)
   - Design prominent contact forms
   - Optimize for specific treatments (Invisalign, implants, cosmetic)

4. **SEO Implementation**
   - Local SEO optimization for Oslo area
   - Treatment-specific keyword targeting
   - Schema markup for dental practice
   - Google Business Profile integration

5. **Technical Implementation**
   - Leverage existing Azure/GitHub workflow
   - Implement analytics and conversion tracking
   - Ensure fast load times and technical SEO

## Expected Outcomes

- 10+ new leads per week (minimum target)
- Improved brand perception
- Higher conversion rates from website visitors
- Better Google ranking for key dental terms
- Positive ROI within first month

## Execution Plan

1. Create redesign prototype (1 week)
2. Present to Dident owner unsolicited (surprise approach)
3. If not interested, deploy anyway as a demonstration
4. Track leads and forward them to prove value
5. Negotiate re-engagement based on demonstrated results
